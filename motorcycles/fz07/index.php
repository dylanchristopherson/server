<h1>2016 Yamaha fz07</h1>

<p1>My third bike is a 2016 Yamaha fz07 bought during the pandemic in 2020<br/></p1>

<img src="../../images/yamaha.jpg">

<br>
<p1>It was sadly sold in 2023</p1>

<br>
<p1>Luckily, I bought it for $5000, added 6000 miles on, and then sold it for $5500! Can't complain about that...</p1>
